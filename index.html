                <h3>Day 1: Barcelona, Spain - Arrival</h3>
                <p><strong>July 2nd, 2025</strong></p>
                <p>
                    We took off from BWI airport around 1:00pm. Unfortunately our train was delayed but no worries for us, we alotted time for any delays. We arrived in NYC Penn Station around 4:00 pm and then Grace led us on the LIRR to Jamaica, and from there we caught the Air Tram to JFK! We boarded our scandinavian airplane around 6:30. Then we sat on the tarmac for about an hour because of thunderstorm delays. We finally took off around 8:30 pm EST. Olivia and Grace somehow got economy plus seats and were treated luxuriously while the rest were in economy. However, we all enjoyed yummy dinner, free wine, and breakfast. Then we landed in Copenhagen at 10:00am. We went through customs (aquiring stamps), and then Cara led us to the Metro and navigated us to Norreport, the city center. We enjoyed delicious hot dogs, saw the canal, and walked through a royal garden. Then we took the metro back to the airport and caught our flight to Barcelona. Again we sat on the tarmac for about an hour and a half due to delays, but it gave us all more naptime. We arrived in Barcelona around 8:00pm charged our phones up and then Claire led us through the bus and metro to get to our cute little Airbnb. UNFORTUNATELY, Barcelona did not bless us with a new stamp #sad. Then we freshened up and enjoyed tapas for dinner around 11:00pm! Then we all came home showered and rested for the night preparing for our first full day in Barcelona! Some of us enjoyed the most recent episode of Love Island, thanks to a generous individual's acquisition of a VPN. So far so good :)
