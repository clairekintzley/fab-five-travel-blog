                <h3>Day 1: Barcelona, Spain - Arrival</h3>
                <p><strong>July 2nd, 2025</strong></p>
                <p>
                    We took off from BWI airport around 1:00pm. Unfortunately our train was delayed but no worries for us, we alotted time for any delays. We arrived in NYC Penn Station around 4:00 pm and then Grace led us on the LIRR to Jamaica, and from there we caught the Air Tram to JFK! We boarded our scandinavian airplane around 6:30. Then we sat on the tarmac for about an hour because of thunderstorm delays. We finally took off around 8:30 pm EST. Olivia and Grace somehow got economy plus seats and were treated luxuriously while the rest were in economy. However, we all enjoyed yummy dinner, free wine, and breakfast. Then we landed in Copenhagen at 10:00am. We went through customs (aquiring stamps), and then Cara led us to the Metro and navigated us to Norreport, the city center. We enjoyed delicious hot dogs, saw the canal, and walked through a royal garden. Then we took the metro back to the airport and caught our flight to Barcelona. Again we sat on the tarmac for about an hour and a half due to delays, but it gave us all more naptime. We arrived in Barcelona around 8:00pm charged our phones up and then Claire led us through the bus and metro to get to our cute little Airbnb. UNFORTUNATELY, Barcelona did not bless us with a new stamp #sad. Then we freshened up and enjoyed tapas for dinner around 11:00pm! Then we all came home showered and rested for the night preparing for our first full day in Barcelona! Some of us enjoyed the most recent episode of Love Island, thanks to a generous individual's acquisition of a VPN. So far so good :)

                <h3>Day 2: Barcelona, Spain - Sagrada Familia and Park Güell</h3>
                <p><strong>July 3rd, 2025</strong></p>
                <p>
                    Today we woke up around 10:00am Barcelona time. We spent the morning getting ready and then walked out of the airbnb to a coffee shop called Origo to get pasteries and coffee. We enjoyed our breakfast on a public bench #yaypublicspaces. Then we headed to Sagrada Familia (shoutout the Kintzleys for tickets). We embarked on our own guided audio tours, which were amazing, and then explored the museum on site. Fun fact: Sagrada Familia's first brick was laid in 1882 and it is still being worked on till this day. AMAZING. After Sagrada Familia we went to lunch and had paella and wine with sprite...soooo yummy! Then we walked home and "napped" and or hung out till the next tour. Around 5:30pm we left for Parque Güell via bus transportation. We toured around the park, listened to audio tours, and danced the cotton eyed joe to live music. After Parque Güell we headed to dinner at Cerveceria Catalana, the restuarnt recommened by the Kintzley's. We waited over an hour (got gelato while we waited) and finally got a seat inside for five. We got tapas, sangria, and dessert and it was well worth the wait. Then we headed home and stopped my a local bar (Bloody Mary) and got some more drinks. Now we are home chatting and prepping for our beach day tomorrow! Barcelona so far so good!!! Yay!

                <h3>Day 3: Barcelona, Spain - Exploring the Waterfront</h3>
                <p><strong>July 4th, 2025</strong></p>
                <p>
                    After a full day of sightseeing yesterday, we took today much slower. We got moving around 12pm (oops) and headed to a local cafe for a latte and pastry. We passed a cute little plaza right around the corner from our Airbnb and plan to head back there for a light dinner and drinks this evening. After our late breakfast we swim suited up and took the tram over to Platja de la Nova Mar Bella. We were pleased to see that the beach was not overly crowded, mostly filled with locals. The water was a perfect temperature and pretty clear so we took our goggles for a spin. After hanging on the beach for awhile, we walked over to a nearby restaurant called Kibo. Three of us had a yummy burger, which felt appropriate for the 4th of July. Then we headed back to our apartment via the tram and got freshened up. For dinner, we walked a few blocks over to La Pepita for a few tapas and some sangria and it was incredible. Dessert was also a must. After dinner we stopped back by Bloody Mary on our walk back. The bartender was kind enough to take a picture of us with our Natty B's for Mr. Tom ;). After one drink we called it a night and headed to bed.
